- Switch-case implementation for menu-driven calculator

## How to Compile and Run

To compile any C file, use:
```
gcc -Wall -Wextra -g3 filename.c -o output/filename
```

To run the executable:
```
./output/filename
```

## Learning Objectives

This collection covers:
- Basic syntax and structure of C programs
- Variables, data types, and operators
- Control structures (if-else, loops, switch)
- Arrays and strings
- Functions and modular programming
- Input/output operations
- Basic algorithms and problem-solving
